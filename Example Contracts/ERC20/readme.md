The ERC-20 (Ethereum Request for Comment 20) standard is a set of rules and conventions that define how a token contract should operate on the Ethereum blockchain. It was proposed by Fabian Vogelsteller and Vitalik Buterin in late 2015 and has since become the most widely adopted standard for creating and managing tokens on the Ethereum platform.

Key features of the ERC-20 standard include:

1.  **Token Functions:**
    
    -   **Total Supply:** The contract must include a function to retrieve the total token supply.
    -   **Balance Inquiry:** Users should be able to check their token balance.
    -   **Transfer:** Tokens can be transferred from one address to another.
    -   **Transfer From:** Allows delegated transfers, useful for trading platforms.
    -   **Approve and Allowance:** Enables one address to approve another to spend a certain number of tokens on its behalf.
2.  **Events:**
    
    -   **Transfer Event:** This event is triggered whenever tokens are transferred.
    -   **Approval Event:** Triggered when an approval for token spending is made.
3.  **Standard Interface:**
    
    -   ERC-20 defines a standard interface, ensuring compatibility with various applications, including wallets, exchanges, and decentralized applications (DApps).
4.  **Security Considerations:**
    
    -   ERC-20 tokens should adhere to security best practices, such as protection against integer overflow and underflow, as well as reentrancy attacks.
5.  **Decimals:**
    
    -   Tokens can be divisible into smaller units, and the number of decimals can be specified in the contract.
6.  **Optional Features:**
    
    -   Some optional features, such as token burning, may be included based on the project's requirements.

The ERC-20 standard provides a common set of rules that allows different tokens to be easily integrated into platforms like exchanges and wallet services. This standardization has played a crucial role in the widespread adoption of tokens on the Ethereum blockchain and has facilitated the creation of diverse ecosystems of decentralized applications and financial instruments.
