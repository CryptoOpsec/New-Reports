The ERC-1155 (Ethereum Request for Comment 1155) standard is a token standard proposed by Enjin in 2018. Unlike ERC-20 and ERC-721, ERC-1155 is a hybrid standard designed to support both fungible and non-fungible tokens within a single smart contract. This standard aims to offer more flexibility and efficiency in managing different types of tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.

Key features of the ERC-1155 standard include:

1.  **Fungible and Non-Fungible Tokens:**
    
    -   ERC-1155 supports both fungible tokens (similar to ERC-20) and non-fungible tokens (similar to ERC-721) within the same contract. This allows developers to create a diverse range of token types within a single deployment.
2.  **Single Contract Deployment:**
    
    -   Unlike ERC-20 and ERC-721, which require separate contracts for each token type, ERC-1155 enables developers to deploy a single contract that can manage multiple token types simultaneously. This reduces the complexity and cost of deploying multiple contracts.
3.  **Gas Efficiency:**
    
    -   ERC-1155 is designed to be more gas-efficient compared to deploying separate contracts for each token type. It optimizes transactions by allowing multiple token types to be managed within a single contract, reducing overall gas costs.
4.  **Batch Transfers:**
    
    -   ERC-1155 supports batch transfers, allowing users to send multiple types of tokens in a single transaction. This feature enhances efficiency and reduces the number of on-chain interactions needed for certain operations.
5.  **Atomic Swaps:**
    
    -   Atomic swaps are supported, enabling the exchange of multiple token types between parties in a single, atomic transaction. This ensures that the swap either fully occurs or is entirely reverted.
6.  **Backwards Compatibility:**
    
    -   ERC-1155 is designed to be backward compatible with ERC-20 and ERC-721. Existing infrastructure and tools that support these standards can be adapted to work with ERC-1155 tokens.
7.  **Use Cases:**
    
    -   ERC-1155 is particularly well-suited for applications that require a combination of fungible and non-fungible tokens, such as blockchain-based games where players may possess both unique items and interchangeable in-game currencies.

Overall, ERC-1155 provides a versatile and efficient solution for managing a diverse array of token types within a single contract, addressing some of the limitations associated with previous token standards.
