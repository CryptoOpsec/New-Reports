The ERC-721 (Ethereum Request for Comment 721) standard is another Ethereum token standard, but it differs significantly from the ERC-20 standard. Proposed by William Entriken, Dieter Shirley, Jacob Evans, and Nastassia Sachs in 2017, ERC-721 defines a standard interface for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum blockchain.

Key features of the ERC-721 standard include:

1.  **Unique Identifiers:**
    
    -   Each token (NFT) within an ERC-721 contract has a unique identifier, making each token distinct.
2.  **Ownership and Transfer:**
    
    -   Unlike ERC-20 tokens, which are interchangeable, ERC-721 tokens are not fungible. Each token is owned by a specific Ethereum address, and ownership can be transferred from one address to another.
3.  **Metadata:**
    
    -   ERC-721 tokens often include metadata, providing additional information about the token, such as its name, description, and other attributes.
4.  **Events:**
    
    -   Similar to ERC-20, ERC-721 includes events that are triggered when tokens are transferred or approved for transfer.
5.  **Enumerable:**
    
    -   ERC-721 tokens can be enumerable, meaning it is possible to get a list of all token IDs within a contract. This feature is useful for applications that require knowledge of all the tokens in existence.
6.  **Interface Extension:**
    
    -   ERC-721 is designed to be extensible, allowing developers to build on top of the standard and add additional functionalities.
7.  **Use Cases:**
    
    -   ERC-721 has found extensive use in applications where unique, distinguishable tokens are essential, such as digital art, collectibles, and gaming assets. Each token represents a distinct, non-interchangeable item.

Popular applications of ERC-721 tokens include CryptoKitties (digital collectibles), Decentraland (virtual real estate), and various blockchain-based games where ownership and uniqueness of in-game assets are crucial.

In summary, ERC-721 is the standard for creating non-fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain, providing a foundation for the development of unique, indivisible digital assets.
